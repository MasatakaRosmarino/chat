A simple chat room where every one who is logged in can chat.
The program has been developed with php + MySQL, html, css with Bootstrap 5.X, and JavaScript.
First it is necessary to sign up with a unique username and a password, then log in with the newly-created credentials.
You can send text messages but not emoticons, nor can you share pictures, video or audio files.
Every chat sent and received is sent and retrieved by an AJAX call, processed by php files, and finally by MySQL database.
